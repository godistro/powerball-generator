                  YadBash Simple Code Crafting

     YadBash is the term we selected to represent the creation of our

     Simplified Yad & Bash Coding that non-programmers can easily follow. 

     We can all build easy user interfaces that accomplish basic tasks 

     such as most common Terminal commands.  

     YadBash Simple Coding uses Yad Graphical User Interface "GUI" to

     build the graphic windows and so much more that YAD GUI offers.

     Background functionality such as file processing, number crunching,

     program launching and multimedia playing is accomplished using 

     non-complicated BASH "Bourne Again Shell" scripting. We use BASH

     as it is used on virtually all Distros of Linux and is indeed used
 
     on all SparkyLinux Distros.     

     YadBash and all our Sparky Operating Simplified programs that we 

     use on SparkyLinux Openbox systems is supported by Robert Cooper.
